When first starting out, it's good to use a GUI to visualize the modifications you are making.
GIT GUI Clients
http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

Other common GIT commands:
git status: see the state of your GIT repository
git checkout: change your files to another state (you can checkout branches or commits: git checkout my_branch or git checkout abcd1234 *some SHA1 hash*)
git diff: see the changes made (you can diff two files to compare them: git diff file1 file2)
git rebase: this is easiest to explain in person (http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-6.html)
git log: see commit history/graph (I usually use: git log --graph --oneline --decorate)
git stash: stash your changes so you can do something else; later when you're ready to continue working you can git stash pop to load to last stash in the stack

Other things to note:
Your entire GIT repository is stored in the .git folder.
All of your GIT configurations are located in .git/config file
I use git status before I issue any GIT commands to make sure I'm at the state I think I am.
