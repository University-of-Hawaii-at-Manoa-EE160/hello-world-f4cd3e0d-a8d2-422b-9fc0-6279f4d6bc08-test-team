                <li>typically with TDD, you will be writing the tests and the programs, whereas, in our case, the graders have written the tests for your programs to be built against</li>
                <li>TDD is an industry best practice</li>
                <li>there are other flavors/extensions of TDD such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">behavior driven development (BDD)</a></li>

            <p>without <code>wget</code> one would need to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>create a new file</li>
              <li>copy &amp; paste the code from <a href="https://github.com/zhaol/ee160/blob/gh-pages/code/hello_world/hello_world.c">hello_world.c</a> to the new file</li>
            </ul>
            <p>doing things without <code>wget</code> is both tedious and error prone (i.e. you might miss copying a character when the programs get larger)</p>
