            <li>There are 2 major contenders in the editor wars.  Most people like either VI or Emacs, both are available to you in Cloud9 IDE.  You can go to "view" -> "keyboard mode" to try out the different editors.  I've never used Emacs on Cloud9 and am not too familiar with how accurately Cloud9 mimics to the real Emacs.

For VI, the Cloud9 version is a bit limited to the full potential of VI so I'm assuming it's the same for Emacs.

Anyways, aside from that, Cloud9 should give you a taste of the 2 different editors.

For VI, your hand stays on the home row keys (j,k, l, semi-colon).  And you'll be switching between command mode and insert mode.  So basically, navigating and saving files will be done in command mode.  The actual typing will be done in insert mode.

To get to insert mode, you press 'i' and the start typing.  To get to command mode, you'll press "esc".  To use specific commands, you either type key combinations or start the command with a colon or forward slash or something other special character depending on your command.

For Emacs, you kind of just start typing and to do the extra functions you use key combinations with CTRL.

For both editors, the fanatics like to customize things to how they feel fits their style.  I stay with the default settings since Cloud9 and other editors that mimic VI (and Emacs) will probably use defaults and applying customized settings and plugins are harder to do.

There are other full featured IDEs like eclipse, redmine, aptana, etc.

But if you want to learn VI, I'm more than happy to guide you along.  But before you decide on VI, you need to decide which of the 2 editors you want to learn:
if you like your fingers to act like they're typing and don't mind switching between modes, then you might like VI (tho you do need to press ESC a lot)
if you don't like switching between modes and don't mind using CTRL a lot, then you might like Emacs</li>
