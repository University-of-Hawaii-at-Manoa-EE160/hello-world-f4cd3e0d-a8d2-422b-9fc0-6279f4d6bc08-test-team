        <p>Development Environment:</p>
        <p>The place where you write your programs, like Microsoft Word is the environment/program where you write documents</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any computer that can compile C</li>
          <li>Recommend using <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9 IDE</a> to make it easier:
            <ul>
              <li>for instructors/TAs to help troubleshoot your issues and answer your questions</li>
              <li>for you to start working by reducing the amount of "setup" work (like installing libraries and programs) you need to do </li>
              <li>for everyone to share knowledge by reducing the amount of environment discrepancies</li>
              <li>for you to work on your code from any machine (as well as giving you all the other benefits of the cloud)</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Fellow Students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration is encouraged (except on midterms and finals)</li>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</p>
              <small>Albert Einstein</small>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Teaching a fellow student will enforce your own understanding</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Learning from a fellow student who has just learned a new concept will be easier than learning from someone who has forgotten why this new concept may be troublesome</li>
          <li>A fellow student who has just learned a concept can explain the concept better because they are aware of the "assumptions" and "gotchas" involved</li>
          <li>Peer-to-peer is a powerful way to learn and share knowledge, just like how social media can powerfully share information and data</li>
          <li>Collaborating does not mean cheating; do collaborate; don't cheat</li>
          <li>Make sure you understand the material and concepts when collaborating; don't just get the answer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fellow Humans:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search online with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> or any other search engine</li>
          <li>Post a question on question and answer forums, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" data-toggle="tooltip" title="StackOverflow (SO) is a free Q&A forum for programming enthusiasts">StackOverflow</a> (it's one of the better programming Q&A sites)</li>

      <h2 class="headline">Expectations</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Expectations for Lecture Hours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instructor will lay out basic examples of concepts</li>
          <li>Instructor will answer as much questions as possible and as quickly as possible; it is understood that having as instant a feedback period can facilitate learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expectations for Time Outside of Lecture Hours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Student will build upon basic concepts from lecture hours by completing assignments</li>
          <li>Students are expected to do the assignments/homeworks/labs</li>
          <li>Assignments/homeworks/labs will require student to build upon basic concepts, ie. there will be concepts not thoroughly explained during lecture hours</li>
          <li>Students are expected to post/ask questions about assignments if they get stuck on particulars of the assignment</li>
          <li>Students are expected to help each other, such as posting answers to other student's questions on <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a></li>
          <li>Students are expected to read the given material before lecture</li>
          <li>Students are expected to do the previous lecture's assignment before lecture as all topics build upon previous topics</li>
          <li>Use the labs to really understand the core concepts of the homeworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expectations for Homework and Lab Assignments</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is the student's responsibility to make sure the TA and grader have access to their workspaces</li>
          <li>It is the student's responsibility to make sure the TA and grader can find the relevant files to the assignments</li>
          <li>If the TA and grader cannot find the files relevant to the assignment, a 0 will be given to the student for the assignment</li>
          <li>This is a large class so we need to make sure the grader and TA can provide feedback for everyone in a timely and efficient manner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expectations for Office Hours and Q&amp;A forum:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Students are expected to research and try the assignments before posting/asking questions</li>
          <li>When a student posts/asks questions, it will help the instructor and fellow classmates to provide helpful answers if the student states what they've tried and also to really isolate what they want to ask</li>
          <li>Usually, when forming the question, the student sometimes should be able to answer the question themselves</li>
          <li>Students are expected to respect each other's posts and comments; we are all here trying to learn a new difficult concept</li>
