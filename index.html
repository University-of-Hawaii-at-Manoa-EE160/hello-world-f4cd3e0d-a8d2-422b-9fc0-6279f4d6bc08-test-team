        <p>Announcements:</p>
        <ul><li>Class announcments will be made on <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a></li></ul>
        <p>Development Environment:</p>
        <p>The place where you write your programs, like Microsoft Word is the environment/program where you write documents</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any computer that can compile C</li>
          <li>Recommend using <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9 IDE</a> to make it easier:
            <ul>
              <li>for instructors to help troubleshoot your issues and answer your questions</li>
              <li>for you to start working by reducing the amount of "setup" work (like installing libraries and programs) you need to do </li>
              <li>for everyone to share knowledge by reducing the amount of environment discrepancies</li>
              <li>for you to work on your code from any machine (as well as giving you all the other benefits of the cloud)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lecture Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hosted by <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> at <a href="http://zhaol.github.io/ee160">http://zhaol.github.io/ee160</a></li>
          <li>Please feel free to correct any mistakes/typos by emailing me or submitting a pull request (extra kudos for a <abbr title="pull request" data-toggle="tooltip">PR</abbr>)</li>
          <li>During lecture, instructor will be using a Cloud9 workspace located at <a href="https://ide.c9.io/zhaol/ee160_lecture">https://ide.c9.io/zhaol/ee160_lecture</a></li>
          <li>Students are free to review at a later time or ask questions or make comments through the workspace during lecture in real time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fellow Students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration is encouraged (except on midterms and finals)</li>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</p>
              <small>Albert Einstein</small>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Teaching a fellow student will enforce your own understanding</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A fellow student who has just learned a concept will be aware of the "assumptions" and "gotchas" involved</li>
          <li>Peer-to-peer is a powerful way to learn and share knowledge, just like how social media can powerfully share information and data</li>
          <li>Collaborating does not mean cheating; do collaborate; don't cheat</li>
          <li>Make sure you understand the material and concepts when collaborating; don't just get the answer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fellow Humans:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search online with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> or any other search engine</li>
          <li>Post a question on question and answer forums, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" data-toggle="tooltip" title="StackOverflow (SO) is a free Q&A forum for programming enthusiasts">StackOverflow</a> (it's one of the better programming Q&A sites)</li>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Expectations for Lecture Hours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instructor will lay out basic examples of concepts</li>
          <li>Instructor will answer as many questions as possible; questions are encouraged</li>
          <li>Lectures are optional, however, it is expected that students that skip lecture understand the material covered in lecture and are able to figure things out</li>
          <li>Instructor will help students who come to lecture first since students who skip lecture are agreeing that they understand the material would be unfair to the students who do attend lecture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expectations for Time Outside of Lecture Hours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instructors will answer questions as quickly as possible; it is understood that having as instant a feedback period can facilitate learning</li>
          <li>Student will build upon basic concepts from lecture hours by completing assignments</li>
          <li>Students are expected to do the assignments/homeworks/labs</li>
          <li>Assignments/homeworks/labs will require student to build upon basic concepts, ie. there will be concepts not thoroughly explained during lecture hours</li>
          <li>Students are expected to post/ask questions on <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a> about assignments if they get stuck on particulars of the assignment</li>
          <li>Students are expected to help each other, such as posting answers to other student's questions on <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a></li>
          <li>Students are expected to do the previous lecture's assignment before lecture as all topics build upon previous topics</li>
          <li>Use the labs to really understand the core concepts of the homeworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expectations for Office Hours and Q&amp;A forum:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Students are expected to research and try the assignments before posting/asking questions on <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a></li>
          <li>When a student posts/asks questions, it will help the instructor and fellow classmates to provide helpful answers if the student states what they've tried and to give as much detail as possible</li>
          <li>Usually, when forming the question, the student sometimes should be able to answer the question themselves</li>
          <li>Students are expected to respect each other's posts and comments; we are all here trying to learn a new difficult concept
