        <p>The mini-project enhancements listed on this page are optional. If you do choose to implement them, please save off the original mini-projet and keep the enhanced mini-project in a separate folder from the original mini-project. The lab instructors are not required to grade or look over the enhanced mini-projects, but they may do so if they are not grading other original mini-projects and have time.</p>

        <p>To enhance this mini-project, you can do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>have the program randomly pull from a file with a list of phrases and words instead of requiring a player to enter in a phrase or word</li>

        <p>To enhance this mini-project, you can do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>implement the Viterbi algorithm to solve for the shortest path
            <ul>
              <li>the Viterbi algorithm, in a nutshell is:
                <p>if you know that the shortest path from San Francisco to Chicago is through Salt Lake City, then you no longer need to keep track of the other paths, like:
                  <ul>
                    <li>San Francisco to Las Vegas to Chicago</li>
                    <li>San Francisco to Tucson to Chicago</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>  
              </li>
              <li>the Viterbit Algorithm has many practical applications such as in communications; so instead of miles you are tracking the probability of a bit being correctly received</li>

        <p>To enhance this mini-project, you can do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After the program has determined the "best" signal, have the program find the amount of time delay between the "best" signal and the exact signal
            <ul>
              <li>assume that all received signals can at most be received 1 second after it was sent, i.e. the maximum propagation delay is 1 second</li>
