        <p>For this lab assignment, you will be turning in <em class="file well well-small">UHusername_UHID_uber_travel_time_and_velocity_histograms.c</em> (e.g. <em class="file well well-small">zhaol_12345678_uber_travel_time_and_velocity_histograms.c</em>)</p>
        <p>It will be beneficial for you to leave your previous lab work untouched by copying them to a new folder for this lab and modify only the files in the new folder</p>
        <p>If you were not able to complete Uber Velocity and Fastest List from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/11/">Lab 11</a>, you can create a brand new program. The feature set between both lab assignments are independent, however, if you could not calculate velocity then calculate a histogram of starting x-positions (3rd column). Just follow the download instructions from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/10/">Lab 10</a></p>
        <p>Update your Uber Velocity and Fastest List program from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/labs/11/">Lab 11</a> to add the following features (or write a new program that does the following):</p>

              <ul>
                <li>you can just output the histogram as a 2 column list like this:

                <li>if you are feeling up to it, you can generate a plot similiar to the one found here: <a href="http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/S13/midterm1.html">http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/S13/midterm1.html</a></li>
