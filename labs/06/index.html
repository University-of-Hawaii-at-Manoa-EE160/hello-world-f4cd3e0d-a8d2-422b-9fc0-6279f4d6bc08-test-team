        <p>Write a program (<em class="file well well-small">UHusername_UHID_averager.c</em> e.g. <em class="file well well-small">zhaol_12345678_averager.c</em>) that will allow the user to enter in numbers and the program will display the average of the numbers at the end.  The program will ask the user after each number is entered if s/he would like to enter in more numbers.</p>

        <p>Write a program (<em class="file well well-small">UHusername_UHID_calculator.c</em> e.g. <em class="file well well-small">zhaol_12345678_calculator.c</em>) that will allow the user to enter in 2 numbers and an arithmetic operator.  The program will then output the result of performing the arithmetic operator on the 2 numbers.</p>

            <ul>The program should:
              <li>accept 2 numbers</li>
              <li>accept an arithmetic operator, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code></li>
              <li>perform the arithmetic, e.g. <code>first_number / second_number</code></li>

            <ul>Be sure you understand the implications of:
              <li>type casting a decimal to an integer, e.g. does it round or does it truncate?</li>
              <li>using the mod operator <code>%</code>, e.g. what is it doing?  when does using <code>%</code> make sense and on which data types?</li>
