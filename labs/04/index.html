      <div class="content">
        <p>write a program that includes a macro file (similar to <em class="file well well-small">common_constants.h</em>)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the macro file will define the value for PI and a function to calculate the area of a square</li>
          <li>the program will ask for a length and then calculate the following:
            <ul>
              <li>circumference of a circle with a diameter equal to the inputted length</li>
              <li>area of a circle with a diameter equal to the inputted length</li>
              <li>area of a square with a side equal to the inputted length</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>if 1 was the inputted length, the program will use macros to print out the following:
<pre>the circumference of the circle is: 3.14
the area of the circle is: 6.28
the area of the square is: 1</pre></li>
