      <h2 class="headline">Problem Statement</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Write a program for the Bank of EE160. The teller will type in the account type and account balance. The program will let the teller know if a minimum balance fee needs to be charged. The Bank of EE160 has saving accounts and checking accounts. For saving accounts, the minimum balance is \$1,000. For checking accounts, the minimum balance is \$500. The program will allow the teller to continue entering in account balances and types until the teller is done entering all of the accounts.</p><br/>
        <p class="text-info">The program will also print out a summary of all the accounts.  This summary will contain the total number of accounts, the total amount in all accounts, the percentage of minimum balance fees relative to the total amount in all accounts, and the percentage of accounts that were charged a minimum balance fee.  Also, after the teller has finished entering in each account's information, the program will calculate the percentage the minimum balance fee is relative to the account balance.</p>
        <p>Assume the minimum balance fee is $35</p>
