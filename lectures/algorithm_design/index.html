          <p>What is an algorithm?:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a step-by-step procedure</li>
            <li>every program is essentially a step-by-step procedure</li>
            <li>so in essence algorithm design is designing your program</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Why is algorithm design important?:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>fixing an algorithm is easier than fixing code</li>
            <li>same reason why you make blueprints for a house before building it</li>
            <li>by designing the entire algorithm before coding, you know ahead of time what to expect and can account for things that you wouldn't have though about</li>
            <li>if you just start coding and find out later you needed to address new scenarios, then you have to go back to your code and put in "hacks", or quick changes that might not be the "correct" way of programming things</li>
            <li>it is hard to think of every scenario beforehand, but thinking about the algorithm will at least flush out some things</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>How to design an algorithm?:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>start from the top and then go down; top-down approach</li>
            <li>be generic and fill in the details after all the major steps are laid out</li>
          </ul>

          <p>An example algorithm for getting milk from the grocery store:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you like to think in words:
<pre>start
  drive to the store
  buy the milk
  drive home
end</pre>
            </li>          
            <li>If you like to think in pictures:<br/>

                <li>take out your wallet</li>

        <ul>
          <li>write out the algorithm in words</li>
          <li>draw out the algorithm in block diagram</li>
          <li>get a sense of which method works better for you so you can practice designing algorithms with words or pictures (though the block diagram still has words)</li>
