      <h2 class="headline">Problem Statement</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Write a program for the Bank of EE160. The teller will type in the account holder, account type, and account balance. The program will let the teller know if a minimum balance fee needs to be charged, the balance after adjusting for the minimum balance fee, and if the teller has entered in an invalid account type. The program will also let the teller know that the account holder is on the bank's stop list and needs to be handled differently. The Bank of EE160 has saving accounts and checking accounts. For saving accounts, the minimum balance is \$1,000. For checking accounts, the minimum balance is \$500. The program will allow the teller to continue entering in account balances and types until the teller is done entering all of the accounts.</p><br/>
        <p>The program will also print out to a file a summary of all the accounts.  This summary will contain the total number of accounts, the total amount in all accounts, the percentage of minimum balance fees relative to the total amount in all accounts, and the percentage of accounts that were charged a minimum balance fee.  Also, after the teller has finished entering in each account's information, the program will display the account holder information and calculate the percentage the minimum balance fee is relative to the account balance.</p>
        <p>After the summary of all the accounts, the program will print out to another file a list of all the account balances entered by the teller.</p>
        <p>Assume the minimum balance fee is $35</p>
        <p>Currently, the only person on the stop list is Obama</p>

            <ul>What are some questions the program needs to ask:

              <li>it needs to check if the account balance is less than $500 for checking account</li>
              <li>it needs to check if the teller wants to exit the program</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>What are some tasks the program need to do:

              <li>it needs to display a message to tell the teller to not charge a minimum balance</li>
              <li>it needs to continue reading in account balances and account types until the user wants to exit the program</li>

<pre>do
  get account holder information

    when yes, then tell the teller to handle the account differently and exit loop
  check if the account is a saving account and less than \$1000

      when yes, tell the teller that the account type is invalid
      otherwise, tell the teller to not charge the minimum balance fee

  check if the account type was valid
    when yes, then
      display account holder information
      display account summary for individual account
      update accounts summary information
      update list of account balances
  ask the user if there are more accounts to be checked
