      <div class="content">
        <p>Write a program for the Bank of EE160. The teller will type in the account type and account balance. The program will let the teller know if a minimum balance fee needs to be charged. The Bank of EE160 has saving accounts and checking accounts. For saving accounts, the minimum balance is \$1,000. For checking accounts, the minimum balance is \$500. <span class="text-info">The program will allow the teller to continue entering in account balances and types until the teller is done entering all of the accounts.</span></p>

            <ul>What are some questions the program needs to ask:

              <li>it needs to check if the account balance is less than $500 for checking account</li>
              <li>it needs to check if the teller wants to exit the program</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>What are some tasks the program need to do:
              <li>it needs to display a message to tell the teller to charge a minimum balance</li>
              <li>it needs to display a message to tell the teller to not charge a minimum balance</li>
