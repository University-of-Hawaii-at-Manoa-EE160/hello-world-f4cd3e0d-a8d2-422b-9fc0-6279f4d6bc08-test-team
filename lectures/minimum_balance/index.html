      <div class="content">
        <p>Write a program for the Bank of EE160. The teller will type in the account type and account balance. The program will let the teller know if a minimum balance fee needs to be charged. The Bank of EE160 has saving accounts and checking accounts. For saving accounts, the minimum balance is \$1,000. For checking accounts, the minimum balance is \$500.</p>

<pre>gets user's age
check if user is younger than 25
  then tell user they have a bright future ahead of them
  otherwise tell user they have years of wisdom they can pay forward
get user's gender
check if user is female
  then tell user that females rock
  otherwise tell user that males rock
get user's GPA
check if user's GPA is greater than or equal to 0
  then check if the user's GPA is less than or equal to 4.0
    then tell user that there is too much emphasis on this number
    otherwise tell user that their GPA is out of this world
  otherwise tell user that their GPA is unbelievable
