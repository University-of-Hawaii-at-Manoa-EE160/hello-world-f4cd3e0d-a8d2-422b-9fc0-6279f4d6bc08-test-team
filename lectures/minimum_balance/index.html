      <div class="content">
        <p>Write a program for the Bank of EE160. The teller will type in the account type and account balance. The program will let the teller know if a minimum balance fee needs to be charged. The Bank of EE160 has saving accounts and checking accounts. For saving accounts, the minimum balance is \$1,000. For checking accounts, the minimum balance is \$500.</p>

            <ul>What are some questions the program needs to ask:

<pre>get user's age
if user is younger than 25
  tell user they have a bright future ahead of them
otherwise
  tell user they have years of wisdom to pay forward
  
ask if user is a programmer
if user is a programmer
  tell user while(!(succeed=try()));
otherwise
  tell user The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
      
get user's GPA
if user's GPA is greater than or equal to 0
  if the user's GPA is less than or equal to 4.0
    tell user that there is too much emphasis on this number
  otherwise
    tell user that their GPA is out of this world
otherwise
  tell user that their GPA is unbelievable
